"""Regression tests: retention must never destroy a live backup.

History: historical_backup_candidates() added every entry in a backup root, so
the current database copies the backup pipeline refreshes in place were treated
as redundant history — retention kept one and deleted the rest on every
--clean.

An adversarial audit of that fix found three more holes it had introduced:
scoping the protection to FILES left every undated live DIRECTORY an
unconditional candidate; symlinks were followed, so `latest -> 2026-08-16`
counted twice and retention kept the link while deleting the real directory;
and matching "any eight digits" as a date stripped protection from account
numbers, phone numbers and epoch stamps. Finally, if every candidate was
classed invalid the keep-list came out empty and the whole set was reclaimed.
